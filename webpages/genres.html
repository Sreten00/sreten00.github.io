			<h1>Afrobeat</h1>
		</div>
<h4>
		<br>
		Afrobeat is a music genre which developed in the 1970s out of a combination of West African musical styles, such as Juju Music,It began in
		Nigeria in the early ‘70s with Ghanaian influences. Nigeria's most referred, mainstream, internationally toured and Grammy recognised Country
		music, Fuji music, which was influenced by the western essembles borrowed from its leading native category (the Juju music) and highlife together
		with American funk and jazz, with a focus on chanted vocals and percussion.<br><br><br>

		<br><br><br>
		The term was coined by Nigerian multi-instrumentalist and bandleader Fela Kuti. It popularised the style both within and outside Nigeria. It was partially
	 	borne out of an attempt to distinguish Fela Kuti's music from the soul music of American artists such as James Brown.<br><br><br><br>

		Afrobeat originated from Ghanaian highlife, Fuji and heavy Nigerian drumbeats. It was later exported to the southern part of Nigeria in
		the 1970s, by Fela Kuti, who experimented with many different forms of contemporary music of the time.<br><br><br><br>

		The new sound hailed from a club
		that he established called the Afrika Shrine. Upon arriving in Nigeria, Kuti also changed the name of his group to Africa '70. The band maintained
		a five-year residency in the Afrika Shrine from 1970 to 1975 while afrobeat thrived among Nigerian youth.</h4>

			<h1>Flamenco</h1><br><br>
		</div>
		<div><h4>
		Flamenco, in its strictest sense, is a professionalized art-form based on the variousfolkloric music traditions of Southern Spain in the autonomous
		communities of Andalusia, Extremadura and Murcia. In a widersense, it refers to these musical traditions and more modern musical styles which have
		themselves been deeply influenced byand become blurred with the development of flamenco over the past two centuries. It includes cante (singing), toque
		(guitar playing),baile (dance), jaleo (vocalizations), palmas (handclapping) and pitos (finger snapping).<br><br>
		<div align=center>
		<img src="../images/flamenco.jpg" style="width:50%"><br><br><br><br>
		The oldest record of flamenco dates to 1774 in the book Las Cartas Marruecas by José Cadalso. The genre originated in the music and
		dance styles of Andalusia, of much older origin.<br><br>
		<img src="../images/derpe.jpg" style="width:35%"><br><br><br>


		In recent years, flamenco has become popular all over the world and is taught in many non-Hispanic countries, especially the United States
	 	and Japan. In Japan, there are more flamenco academies than there are in Spain.<br><br><br>
		<img src="../images/fj.jpg" style="width:55%"><br><br><br>


		Palos (formerly known as cantes) are flamenco styles, classified by criteria such as rhythmic pattern, mode, chord progression, stanzaic form and
	 	geographic origin.There are over 50 different palos, some are sung unaccompanied while others have guitar or other accompaniment.<br><br><br>
		<img src="../images/palos.jpg" style="width:55%"><br><br><br>

		In traditional flamenco, young people are not considered to have the emotional maturity to adequately convey the duende (soul) of the genre.
	 	Therefore, unlike other dance forms, where dancers turn professional early to take advantage of youth and strength, many flamenco dancers do
	 	not hit their peak until their thirties and will continue to perform into their fifties and beyond.<br><br><br>
